        <p>This homemade pretzel recipe is great! After spending so much money on those mall pretzels, I thought I'd try making some myself. They are a bit sweeter than other types and are buttery. Dip the hot pretzel in melted butter and coat with your favorite flavors.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Water: You’ll need 5 ¼ cups of water, divided.</li> 
            <li>Yeast: The recipe starts with four teaspoons of active dry yeast dissolved in water with sugar.</li> 
            <li>Sugar: Dissolve a teaspoon of white sugar with the yeast and use ½ cup white sugar for the dough.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the pretzel dough structure.</li>
            <li>Salt: You’ll need salt for the dough and to sprinkle on top of the pretzels.</li>
            <li>Oil: Coat a bowl with vegetable oil before you let the dough rise.</li>
            <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the dough rise.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast with sugar and water.</li> 
            <li>Make the dough and knead it into a ball.</li> 
            <li>Place the dough ball in an oil bowl, turning the ball to coat.</li> 
            <li>Cover and let rise.</li> 
            <li>Turn the dough out, divide into equal pieces, roll into ropes, and shape into pretzels.</li> 
            <li>Dip each pretzel in a mixture of hot water and salt.</li> 
            <li>Sprinkle with salt and bake until brown.</li>
        </ol>
