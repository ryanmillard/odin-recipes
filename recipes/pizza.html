        <p>This homemade pretzel recipe is great! After spending so much money on those mall pretzels, I thought I'd try making some myself. They are a bit sweeter than other types and are buttery. Dip the hot pretzel in melted butter and coat with your favorite flavors.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
